Background
----------

Individual disability income (IDI) insurance protects a policy holder from a loss of income from a 
qualifying accident or sickness event. The leading `individual` in IDI is to distinguish this form of 
insurance from group long term disability (GLTD) insurance which is commonly bundled as a benefit 
within an employee benefits package provided by an employer to employees. 

Market
------

IDI insurance is purchased directly by indiviudals (indiviudal-bill) who are looking to protect 
themselves from a loss of income. Usually, these people do not have a GLTD policy available to 
them. This typically includes professionals (e.g., doctors, lawyers) and small business owners 
and employees. Individual-bill policies are typically underwritten.

IDI insurance is also purchased by employees in an employer-sponsored market. The administration 
is similar to typical group benefits with the billing going through the employer, though, the 
employer may pay all, partial, or none of the premiums. Depending on the percentage of premium
paid by the employer and the uptake of enrollment from employees, underwriting can vary from 
individual underwriting (like the individual market) to guarantee issued (like traditional group 
benefits).

Typically, the policy holder and person covered by IDI insurance are the same person. However, 
business coverage does exist where the business can recieve a benefit in case an owner or 
employee becomes disbaled. This includes key person (KP) coverage and business overhead (BOE) 
coverage. KP insurance is purchased by the business to cover a loss of income if a key person within 
the business becomes disabled (e.g., a top producing sales associate). Note this person can also 
have coverage for themselves where they are the beneficiary. Business overhead coverage is similar 
though it is meant to cover the overhead of running the business if an individual with it were to 
become disabled.

Riders
------

*Note the descriptions below correspond to how they are handled in this model. Varaiation of the following 
doe exist in industry.*

- **Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) - Available**
    
    A COLA rider increases your benefits while a policy holder is on claim. This is used to enhance coverage
    and protect an individual from inflation while on claim. The adjustment comes through as a percentage 
    increase that compounds each year while on claim.

- **Social Insurance Supplemental (SIS) - Planned**

    A SIS rider provides a benefit when the policy holder is not receiving a 
    `Social Security disability (SSD) <https://www.ssa.gov/disability/>`_ benefit or a partial benefit when the 
    SSD benefit is less than the SIS rider coverage.  

- **Catastrophic Disability (CAT) - Planned**

    A CAT rider provides an additional benefit amount if the disabiling event meets the catastriophic criteria.
    This is also referred as a long term care (LTC) rider as the criteria of catastrophic is usually not being 
    able to perform `2 of the 6 activies of daily life <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adl.asp>`_ which 
    is typically the benefit trigger for LTC insurance.

- **Residual Benefit (RES) - Planned**

    A residual benefit rider provides a partial benefit if the policy holder is still able to work at some capacity.
    As an example, if an individual loses 50% of their income due to a accident or sickness event, this rider benefit
    would pay 50% of the disability benefit.

- **Return-of-Premium (ROP) - Available**

    A return-of-premium (ROP) rider is a benefit that returns a percentage of the paid premiums less any paid benefits 
    to the policy holder on a 7 or 10 year cadence.
