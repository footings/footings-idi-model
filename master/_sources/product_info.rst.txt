Background
----------

Individual disability income (IDI) insurance protects a policy holder from a loss of income from a
qualifying accident or sickness event. The leading `individual` in IDI is to distinguish this form of
insurance from group long term disability (GLTD) insurance which is commonly bundled as a benefit
within an employee benefits package provided by an employer to employees.

Market
------

IDI insurance is purchased directly by indiviudals (indiviudal-bill) who are looking to protect
themselves from a loss of income. Usually, these people do not have a GLTD policy available to
them. This typically includes professionals (e.g., doctors, lawyers) and small business owners
and employees. Individual-bill policies are typically underwritten.

IDI insurance is also purchased by employees in an employer-sponsored market. The administration
is similar to typical group benefits with the billing going through the employer, though, the
employer may pay all, partial, or none of the premiums. Depending on the percentage of premium
paid by the employer and the uptake of enrollment from employees, underwriting can vary from
individual underwriting (like the individual market) to guarantee issued (like traditional group
benefits).

Typically, the policy holder and person covered by IDI insurance are the same person. However,
business coverage does exist where the business can recieve a benefit in case an owner or
employee becomes disbaled. This includes key person (KP) coverage and business overhead (BOE)
coverage. KP insurance is purchased by the business to cover a loss of income if a key person within
the business becomes disabled (e.g., a top producing sales associate). Note this person can also
have coverage for themselves where they are the beneficiary. Business overhead coverage is similar
though it is meant to cover the overhead of running the business if an individual with it were to
become disabled.
